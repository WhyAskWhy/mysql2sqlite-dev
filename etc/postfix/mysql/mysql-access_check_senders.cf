# Purpose: Whitelist or blacklist senders based on the MAIL FROM address

##############################################################################
# Search the specified access(5) database for the MAIL FROM address, domain,
# parent domains, or localpart@, and execute the corresponding action.
##############################################################################

# MAIL FROM address is the:
#
# *  envelope sender address
#
# *  where bounces will be sent
#
# *  the value for Return-Path field once it arrives at the destination. In
#    other words, it is not part of the message header during SMTP
#    transport, but it is added by the MDA (mail delivery agent) during
#    delivery.
#
# *  the address that will receive bounces to messages from the MTA, if
#    the To: address doesn't exist.

# Note: This file should be accessible by only root and postfix users
#
#   chown root:postfix /etc/postfix/*/*.cf
#   chmod u=rw,g=r,o= /etc/postfix/*/*.cf
